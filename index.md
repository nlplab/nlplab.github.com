# {{ page.title }} #

NLPLab is a virtual lab, born out of the idea that collaboration is easiest to
do when there is some infrastructure, that software and resources need to be
maintained and hosted after academic institutions "die".
We think that the easiest way to do this is to go virtual (we are not the
first to mention a "virtual" lab, at least
[Tetsuya Sakai][sakai] has pointed out that his "lab" is virtual since
Microsoft Research Asia does not have labs).
In short: We are a non-affiliation affiliation.

As-of-yet, we are trying to find our way and establish a purpose.
Something along the lines of what [Jason Eisner][eisner] wrote for his 2012
ACL candidacy would be great as inspiration.

## Hosted Projects and Resources ##

Although the lab does not endorse specific projects, here are a few that are
hosted on its infrastructure:

* [NERSuite][nersuite], a named entity recognition toolkit
* [Word representations][wordreprs], sharing and evaluating word
    representations
* [brat][brat], a text annotation and visualisation tool

If you have an interesting NLP research project of your own that you are
dedicated to and want to host it somewhere, do get in touch with us.

## Contact ##

We have [a GitHub page][nlplab_github] where you can display your membership

For mail contact it is adviced to get in touch with
[Pontus Stenetorp][stenetorp] for now (we really should have a mailing list).

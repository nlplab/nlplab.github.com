Oh, you are a bit early... this page isn't ready yet (we know, this wasn't
even cool back in the days of GeoCities, but this is better than just a
message from a web host saying "domain registered, but nothing here").
May we humbly suggest having a look at [brat: a a Web-based Tool
for NLP-Assisted Text Annotation](http://brat.nlplab.org) or
[NERSuite](http://nersuite.nlplab.org) for now?

## What is NLPLab? ##

Okay, we didn't quite get rid of you that easily.
NLPLab is a virtual lab, born out of the idea that collaboration is easiest to
do when there is some infrastructure, that software and resources need to be
maintained after academic institutions "die".
We think that the easiest way to do this is to go virtual (we are not the
first to mention a "virtual" lab, at least
[Tetsuya Sakai](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/tesakai/) has
pointed out that his "lab" is virtual since Microsoft Research Asia does not
have labs).
We host projects and discussion, have a server or two, and if you are
interested, feel free to contact
[Pontus Stenetorp](http://pontus.stenetorp.se/contact.html).

In short: We are a non-affiliation affiliation.
